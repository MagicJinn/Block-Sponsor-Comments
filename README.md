# Block Sponsor Comments

## Browser extension to remove sponsors from youtube descriptions and comments.

A browser extension that removes a preset list of video sponsors from youtube video descriptions and comments.

Meant to be used in combination with [Sponsorblock](http://sponsor.ajay.app). 
I fully endorse this extension being integrated/merged with any other application with or without credit (Looking at you, Sponsorblock ;P)

## Microsoft Edge <a id="microsoftedge"></a>

Microsoft Edge support has been ended, and the extension has been delisted. This is because Edge is consistently the slowest at reviewing extensions, constantly rejects my submissions with vague reasons why, and are allround terrible. Download the Chrome version instead.
